# C++ Learning Classes Course

## Overview

Welcome to the C++ Learning Classes Course! This course is designed to teach you the fundamentals and advanced concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how to create and use classes, manage memory, and implement advanced C++ features in real-world applications.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into modules that will guide you step-by-step through various concepts of C++ programming. Each module includes practical examples, exercises, and assignments to help reinforce the learning process.

   - Practical project to apply the learned concepts

## Requirements

To get started with the course, you will need:

- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- **Text Editor or IDE** (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Code::Blocks)
- **Basic understanding of programming** (preferred, but not required)
